WELCOME TO POKER 112

note: in my video I missed the fact that I had a straight and beat the ai 
    sorry for the confusion

cards face downas their hand. Over several betting rounds, five more cards 
are dealt face up in the middle of the table. These face-up cards are called 
the 'community cards.' Each player is free to use the community cards in 
combination with their hole cards to build a five-card poker hand.
